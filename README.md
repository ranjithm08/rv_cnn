Prediction of Radial Velocities(RV's) using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

Radial Velocities are important in the simulation of dynamics of Galaxies. this project involves the convolutional neural networks to predict the radial velocities for the unseen spectra of a star. Initially we provide spectra and the corresponding radial velocities to the network to learn, this spectra has high signal to noise ratio than the spectra we provide for prediction. 
in terms of signal to noise ratio the training sample and the observed sample are mutually exclusive. observed sample has the low signal to noise ratio.

There are two notebooks, one contains the training the network part and the other contains the plots which we want to look at
